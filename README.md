# data-visualization
This repository contains visualizations created during my completion of the "Python for Data Visualization" course on LinkedIn Learning. The course covered fundamental data visualization techniques using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn in Python. I used the Human Resources Data Set to create some visualization to practice the newly learned skills.
